## Project Tutorial

### Once a user navigates to the site they will be greeted by a welcome page

** Within this page, there will be a single example card with a fact stated per the last card created. In the navigation bar lies 4 buttons, ** 
1. Clicking on "FactCards" will navigate you back to the home screen
2. Clicking on "Users" will let anyone view any users that have signed up
3. Clicking on "Sign Up" will allow a guest to create an account with an Email and Password, as-well as a Password Confirmation
4. Clicking on "Log In" will allow users to be able to login with their Email and Password

** Once a User is logged in, your email will be displayed on the upper right side. This will generate a different navigation bar with newer buttons, **
1. Clicking on "FactCards" will navigate you back to the home screen
2. Clicking on "Users" will let anyone view any users that have signed up. (Now that a user is logged in, they will be able to see a link to remove a user. However only "admin" user is capable of doing so)
3. Clicking on "Log Out" will allow a user to safely logout of the program 
4. Clicking on "All Cards" will take a user to the table with all cards being displayed. (If a "guest" happens to find this link they will only prompted the option to show each card)
5. Clicking on "New Card" will allow a user to generate a new card full of fun facts

** Once a user has been able to navigate to "All Cards", a table with only 5 cards on each page is displayed **
** As long as a user is logged in there will be 3 options for each card, **
1. Clicking on "Show" will take a user to the card choosen inorder to get more knowledge on something new
2. Clicking on "Edit" Will allow a user to modify any changes that each card might need
3. Clicking on "Destroy" link will generate a confrimation pop-up to delete the mentioned card 

** Once a user has reached a specific card with the "Show" link they will be able to view all conntent for each card **
** A Guest will also be able to view any card with tweaking around if they do not wish to sign up **
** Within the "Show" link a user has a few options, **
1. Each card contains a Subject, Content, Fact and References section
2. There will also be an edit button if user does not wish to go back a page 
3. A user/guest will be able to comment on any card, as-well as they will not need to submit their username. Anyone can submit anything in the "Commenter" text field
4. However, only a logged in user will be able to destroy any comments
