<p>Once a user navigates to the site they will be greeted by a welcome page.</p>

<p>Within this page, there will be a single example card with a fact stated per the last card created. In the navigation bar lies 4 buttons,</p>

<ul>
<li>Clicking on "FactCards" will navigate you back to the home screen.</li>
<li>Clicking on "Users" will let anyone view any users that have signed up.</li>
<li>Clicking on "Sign Up" will allow a guest to create an account with an Email and Password, as-well as a Password Confirmation.</li>
<li>Clicking on "Log In" will allow users to be able to login with their Email and Password.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once a User is logged in, your email will be displayed on the upper right side. This will generate a different navigation bar with newer buttons, </p>

<ul>
<li>Clicking on "FactCards" will navigate you back to the home screen.</li>
<li>Clicking on "Users" will let anyone view any users that have signed up. (Now that a user is logged in, they will be able to see a link to remove a user. However only "admin" user is capable of doing so).</li>
<li>Clicking on "Log Out" will allow a user to safely log out of the program.</li>
<li>Clicking on "All Cards" will take a user to the table with all cards being displayed. (If a "guest" happens to find this link they will only prompted the option to show each card).</li>
<li>Clicking on "New Card" will allow a user to generate a new card full of fun facts.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once a user has been able to navigate to "All Cards", a table with only 5 cards on each page is displayed 
As long as a user is logged in there will be 3 options for each card, </p>

<ul>
<li>Clicking on "Show" will take a user to the card chosen in order to get more knowledge on something new.</li>
<li>Clicking on "Edit" Will allow a user to modify any changes that each card might need.</li>
<li>Clicking on "Destroy" link will generate a confirmation popup to delete the mentioned card.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once a user has reached a specific card with the "Show" link they will be able to view all content for each card 
A Guest will also be able to view any card with tweaking around if they do not wish to sign up.
Within the "Show" link a user has a few options, </p>

<ul>
<li>Each card contains a Subject, Content, Fact and  section.</li>
<li>There will also be an edit button if user does not wish to go back a page.</li>
<li>A user/guest will be able to comment on any card, as-well as they will not need to submit their username. Anyone can submit anything in the "Commenter" text field.</li>
<li>However, only a logged in user will be able to destroy any comments.</li>
</ul>
